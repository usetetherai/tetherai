# What Won't Work — And Why

Some tools that sound healthy or helpful in theory can actually *delay real safety* or *reinforce the cycle* when abuse is present.  
Here’s what often doesn’t work—and why:

---

## Couples Counseling

In abusive dynamics, therapy can become a tool for manipulation.  
The abuser may perform well in front of a therapist, shift blame, or use therapy language to gaslight or control.  
Joint counseling can make survivors feel invalidated or pressured to “compromise” when the real issue is power imbalance—not communication.

---

## Behavior Contracts

Behavior contracts are often suggested as a structured way to promote change.  
But in abusive relationships, contracts are often ignored, twisted into weapons (“you said YOU wouldn’t do XYZ either”), or used to show surface compliance without real accountability or change.

---

## Forgiveness Frameworks

Survivors are often encouraged to forgive too soon or without real repair.  
Forgiveness without justice or safety can retraumatize, silence pain, and enable repeat harm.

---

## “Better Communication” Advice

Abuse is not a communication problem—it’s a control problem.  
Communication tools like “I statements” or “active listening” can be used against survivors or weaponized to create false equivalency.

---

## Waiting for Rock Bottom

Many survivors wait, hoping things will finally hit a breaking point.  
But for chronic abusers, there often is no rock bottom—only a new form of harm.  
Your safety doesn’t have to wait for their collapse.

# Bottom Line

These tools are designed for **misunderstandings**, not **power imbalances**.  
If someone repeatedly hurts, manipulates, or controls you, these strategies won’t stop the cycle.  

Real change requires more than promises.  
It requires **safety, accountability, and often, separation**.
